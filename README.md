#### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
Developed an LQR controller for the closed loop system and used Lyapunov's Indirect Method to certify stability using MATLAB

Obtained a Luenberger observer for the output and developed an LQG controller for the closed loop system using Simulink

Implemented both the LQR and the LQG to the non-linear model as well

Tools Used : MATLAB and Simulink
