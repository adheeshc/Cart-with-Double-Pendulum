# Cart-with-Double-Pendulum

#### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
Developed an LQR controller for the closed loop system and used Lyapunov's Indirect Method to certify stability using MATLAB

Obtained a Luenberger observer for the output and developed an LQG controller for the closed loop system using Simulink

Implemented both the LQR and the LQG to the non-linear model as well

Tools Used : MATLAB and Simulink

#### **FILE DESCRIPTION**

Controls_project.m - LQR and LQG for linearized system 

LQR_non_linear.slx - LQR for the non-linear system

Luenberger_non_linear.slx - Luenberger observer for the non-linear system

Final Project.pdf - Project Requirements

#### **RUN INSTRUCTIONS**

1) Run Controls_project.m comment/uncommenting as necessary for linear system
2) Run LQR_non_linear.slx to run the Simulink for LQR of non-linear system 
3) Luenberger_non_linear.slx to run the Simulink for Luenberger Observer of non-linear system
